0.3.0
=====
* Made parser less fragile regarding notes format:
  * Stopped trying to parse author as "lastName, firstName", which isn't always respected
  * Pre-process bookmarks, which do not have "On Page ..." in their second line
  * Ignore case (e.g. on "on", "Page")
  * When a line import fails, print a failure log instead of crashing

0.2.0, 0.2.1, 0.2.2
